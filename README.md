# Perplexity AI Telegram Bot

A powerful Telegram bot that integrates with Perplexity's Sonar API, providing AI-powered search, reasoning, and assistance to Telegram users. This project was inspired by Perplexity's official WhatsApp integration, but created for Telegram's massive global user base of over 800 million active users.

## Inspiration

After seeing Perplexity AI's integration with WhatsApp, I wanted to bring similar functionality to Telegram, which has a larger user base across many countries and offers more flexible bot capabilities. Telegram is particularly popular in regions where WhatsApp isn't the dominant messenger, giving this integration a wider potential reach. This project demonstrates how Perplexity's powerful AI search and reasoning capabilities can be leveraged on the Telegram platform.

## Features

- üì∞ **Breaking News Updates**: Subscribe to topics and receive automatic updates at chosen intervals
- üíª **Code Analysis & Enhancement**: Send code snippets for analysis, optimization, and bug fixing
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Model Selection**: Choose from different Perplexity models for different use cases

## Technology Stack

- **FastAPI**: Modern, high-performance asynchronous web framework
- **Python-Telegram-Bot**: Comprehensive Python wrapper for the Telegram Bot API
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful, open-source relational database
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization for easy deployment
- **Perplexity Sonar API**: AI models with real-time web search capabilities
- **APScheduler**: Advanced Python scheduler for reminders and news updates

## Judging Criteria Addressed

### Technological Implementation
- **Quality Software Development**: The project follows clean architecture principles with separation of concerns (services, models, bot handlers), robust error handling, and comprehensive logging.
- **Tool Leverage**: We thoroughly leverage Perplexity's Sonar API, utilizing multiple models (Pro, Reasoning, Deep Research) and features (web search, code analysis).
- **Code Quality**: The codebase maintains consistency in coding style, uses typed hints for better IDE support, employs async/await patterns for efficient I/O operations, and includes comprehensive documentation.

### Design
- **User Experience**: The bot provides an intuitive conversational interface with clear command documentation, interactive buttons for settings, formatted responses with proper citations, and easy-to-use natural language inputs.
- **Frontend/Backend Balance**: While Telegram provides the frontend UI, we've enhanced it with custom inline keyboards, specially formatted responses, and an intelligent conversational flow. The backend is robust with a database-driven persistence layer, scheduled background tasks, and efficient API integration.

### Potential Impact
- **Target Community**: For researchers, students, developers, and professionals, this bot provides immediate access to AI-powered research and analysis tools without requiring additional apps.
- **Beyond Target Community**: The bot could serve as an educational tool in regions with limited internet access but good Telegram connectivity, as a real-time news curator for journalists, or as a code assistant for development teams.

### Quality of the Idea
- **Creativity**: The integration of scheduled breaking news, intelligent code analysis, and natural language reminders creates a unique AI assistant experience specific to Telegram.
- **Improvement Over Existing Solutions**: While Perplexity offers a WhatsApp integration, our solution adds Telegram support with expanded features (recurring reminders, news subscriptions, code analysis) and enhanced user interaction patterns.

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Telegram Bot Token (obtained from BotFather)
- Perplexity API Key

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Create a Telegram Bot**:
   - Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
   - Send `/newbot` and follow instructions to create a bot
   - Save the API token provided

2. **Get a Perplexity API Key**:
   - Sign up at [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
   - Go to account settings and generate an API key

3. **Clone and Configure**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perplexity-telegram-bot.git
   cd perplexity-telegram-bot
   
   # Create environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env file with your credentials
   nano .env
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`: Your Telegram Bot token
   - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`: Your Perplexity API key
   - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (default: postgres://user:password@db:5432/perplexity_bot)
   - `WEBHOOK_URL`: (Optional) If deploying with webhooks instead of polling
   - `ADMIN_USER_IDS`: Comma-separated list of admin Telegram user IDs

5. **Start the Bot**:
   ```bash
   # Build and start containers
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Check logs
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

### Testing the Bot

1. **Basic Tests**:
   - Open Telegram and search for your bot by username
   - Send `/start` to initialize the bot
   - Send a simple question like "What is the weather in New York?"

2. **Feature Testing**:
   - **Test thinking mode**: Send `/thinking` to toggle thinking mode, then ask a complex question
   - **Test reminders**: Say "Remind me to check email in 10 minutes"
   - **Test news subscription**: Use `/subscribe AI` to get regular updates on AI
   - **Test code analysis**: Send a code snippet wrapped in triple backticks with a question
   - **Test model selection**: Use `/model` to change the AI model

3. **Debugging**:
   - Check container logs for errors: `docker-compose logs -f`
   - Ensure PostgreSQL container is running properly
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
